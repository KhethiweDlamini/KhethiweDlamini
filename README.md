## Welcome 👋

ChatGPT and Copilot are probably sick of my neediness, but it's all love 😊

A little about me...
- 🛠️ I work at the intersection of data, tech, art, and innovation to design systems that empower people and drive change.
- 🎮 I also code games for fun. Check out my latest installment: [Triple S Icebreaker](https://khethiwedlamini.github.io/triples_ice_breaker/)
- 🌱 Areas: Statistics, healthcare, education, complex biological systems, computing, and systems engineering.
